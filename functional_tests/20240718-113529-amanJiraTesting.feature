Feature: API Testing Scenarios

Scenario: Setting up a credit card application
Given the API base URL 'http://localhost:3000'
And a valid credit card application details
When I send a POST request to '/credit-card-application' with the application details
Then the response status should be 200
And the response should contain 'Application successfully setup'

Scenario: Invalid credit card application setup
Given the API base URL 'http://localhost:3000'
And invalid or incomplete credit card application details
When I send a POST request to '/credit-card-application' with the application details
Then the response status should be 400
And the response should contain 'Invalid application details'

Scenario: OpenAPI-generator source code generation
Given the API base URL 'http://localhost:3000'
And valid openapi specifications
When I send a POST request to '/generate-source-code' with the specifications
Then the response status should be 200
And the response should contain 'Server code successfully generated'

Scenario: Invalid OpenAPI specifications
Given the API base URL 'http://localhost:3000'
And invalid openapi specifications
When I send a POST request to '/generate-source-code' with the specifications
Then the response status should be 400
And the response should contain 'Invalid OpenAPI specifications'

Scenario: Addition of code logic using GitHub Copilot
Given the API base URL 'http://localhost:3000'
And valid code logic requirements
When I send a POST request to '/add-code-logic' with the requirements
Then the response status should be 200
And the response should contain 'Code logic successfully added'

Scenario: Invalid code logic requirements
Given the API base URL 'http://localhost:3000'
And invalid or ambiguous code logic requirements
When I send a POST request to '/add-code-logic' with the requirements
Then the response status should be 400
And the response should contain 'Invalid code logic requirements'

Scenario: Generation of Karate API tests
Given the API base URL 'http://localhost:3000'
And valid API endpoints and expected responses
When I send a POST request to '/generate-karate-tests' with the endpoints and responses
Then the response status should be 200
And the response should contain 'Karate tests successfully generated'

Scenario: Invalid API details for Karate tests
Given the API base URL 'http://localhost:3000'
And invalid or ambiguous API details
When I send a POST request to '/generate-karate-tests' with the details
Then the response status should be 400
And the response should contain 'Invalid API details'

Scenario: Execution of Karate API tests
Given the API base URL 'http://localhost:3000'
And generated Karate API tests
When I send a POST request to '/execute-karate-tests' with the tests
Then the response status should be 200
And the response should contain 'Tests executed successfully'

Scenario: Invalid Karate tests execution
Given the API base URL 'http://localhost:3000'
And faulty or incomplete Karate tests
When I send a POST request to '/execute-karate-tests' with the tests
Then the response status should be 400
And the response should contain 'Invalid Karate tests'

Scenario: Performance of the credit card application setup process
Given the API base URL 'http://localhost:3000'
And valid credit card application details
When I send a POST request to '/credit-card-application' with the application details
Then the response status should be 200
And the response time should be less than 5000 milliseconds

Scenario: Scalability of the generated source code
Given the API base URL 'http://localhost:3000'
And an increased load or request frequency
When I send multiple POST requests to '/generate-source-code' with valid openapi specifications
Then all the responses should have status 200
And the server should not crash

Scenario: Reliability of the code logic added using GitHub Copilot
Given the API base URL 'http://localhost:3000'
And a range of different logic requirements
When I send multiple POST requests to '/add-code-logic' with the requirements
Then all the responses should have status 200
And the generated code logic should be accurate

Scenario: Robustness of the Karate API tests
Given the API base URL 'http://localhost:3000'
And a range of different API scenarios
When I send multiple POST requests to '/generate-karate-tests' with the scenarios
Then all the responses should have status 200
And the generated tests should accurately identify pass/fail scenarios

Scenario: Security of the credit card application setup process
Given the API base URL 'http://localhost:3000'
And valid credit card application details
When I send a POST request to '/credit-card-application' with the application details
Then the response status should be 200
And the response should not contain sensitive information
And the stored application details should be encrypted
